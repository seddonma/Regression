# Executive Summary
Using a dataset from 1974 comprising 32 cars, a linear model was developed to explore the relationship between a car's miles-per-gallon (MPG) and whether the car has an automatic or manual transmission. The resulting model shows that the presence of menual transmission improves MPG performance by 7.245 miles/gallon.
